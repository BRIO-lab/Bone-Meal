This repo is for moving our JTML neural network code to PyTorch Lightning and using WandB logging.



## How to Use:

- Be in the LitJTML directory
- Have the right conda environment
- call `python scripts/fit.py my_config` where `my_config` is the name of the config.py file in the `config/` directory.
